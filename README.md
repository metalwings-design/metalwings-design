 Hi, I’m Sanket.
 
I work at the intersection of data, statistics, and applied research. My primary focus is econometrics, data analysis, and computational methods using R and Python. I enjoy transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that inform decisions and solve real-world problems.

This GitHub page showcases selected projects and technical notes from my ongoing learning journey.
