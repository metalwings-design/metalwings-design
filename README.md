 Hi, I’m Sanket.
 
I work with data, statistics, and research.
I enjoy analyzing data, finding patterns, and turning numbers into useful insights. My work mainly involves econometrics, data analysis, and programming using R and Python.
I like learning new tools, improving my skills, and working on real-world problems.

This GitHub page contains some of my projects, experiments, and learning notes.
