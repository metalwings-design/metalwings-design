 Hi, I’m Sanket.
 
I work at the intersection of data, econometrics, and applied analytics. I specialize in transforming complex datasets into structured insights that support decision-making, policy evaluation, and strategic problem-solving. My work combines statistical modeling, empirical research, and programming in R and Python to build rigorous and practical analytical solutions.

I am particularly interested in applying quantitative methods to real-world challenges — from development and public policy to business and operational analytics. I enjoy designing analytical frameworks, validating assumptions through data, and communicating findings in a clear and actionable way.

This page features selected projects. I am open to collaborations, consulting, and research partnerships where data-driven thinking can create measurable impact.
